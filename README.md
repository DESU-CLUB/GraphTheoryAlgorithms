### Credits: <br>
Most of the code here was inspired by [William Fiset's course on Graph Theory Algorithms on Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/graph_theory_algorithms/index.asp) 

The code for Kosaraju's was inspired by the code on [Geeks4geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strongly-connected-components/)
